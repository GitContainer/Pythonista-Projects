Creating a **Bible App** with **Pythonista** to learn how to use the Sqlite3 module.

Database from [here](https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases)

This project will demonstrate how to:

1. Query an SQlite database with Python
2. Load data from a database into Pythonista's **ui.View()**s
3. File handling with Python
4. Using the **sound** module
5. Creating alerts using the **console** module
6. Work with the **TableView** module and pass data from one to another
7. Use the **datetime** module to create a timestamp
8. Use the **lambda** function
9. Use list **comprehension**
10. Using segmented controls

ToDo:
- [x] Use ~~regular expressions~~ sqlite3 to create a **search bar**. (I may explore fuzzy search algorithms later). Got help from [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3671761/how-to-search-for-a-substring-in-sqlite)
- [x] Themes using json. Didn't have to use JSON. Functionality is built into the `editor` module.
- [ ] I have to switch chapters and books around so that you can tap "Micah 1" instead of "1 Michah."
- [x] Old Testament and New Testament toggle doesn't work right now.
- [x] Search functionality
- [ ] Add cross reference (might use [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19472922/reading-external-sql-script-in-python) approach or [this](https://github.com/tommasoturchi/mysql-connector-pythonista) repo discussed [here]([this](https://forum.omz-software.com/topic/3334/mysql-in-pythonista)))
- [ ] **Clean up** code and create better variable names and comments. Polish.
- [x] Translations


This projects uses the `bible-sqlite` database. The `kjv` database is there for you to play with if you would like.
