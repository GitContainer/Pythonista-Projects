This example app demonstrates how to use UI controls to **save and load text files** from and into a text view.

It also uses **regular expressions** for file name format verification.

Type the name "test.txt" into the name field and press "Load" to load it.

You can re-load this file with "intro.md"

You can also create files of your own.

An adaptation of this app would use a webview instead of a text view.

File names are case-sensitive
