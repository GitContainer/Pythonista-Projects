Creating a bible app with Pythonista to learn how to use the Sqlite3 module.

This project will demonstrate how to:

1. Query an SQlite database with Python
2. Use regular expressions to create a search bar. (I may explore fuzzy search algorithms later)
3. Load data from a database into a Pythonista's `ui.View()`s
4. Python file handling
