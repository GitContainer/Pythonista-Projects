# Pythonista-Projects
A collection of projects and tests I made with the IOS [Pythonista](http://omz-software.com/pythonista/) app.


Hopefully eventually I will get into the [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIKit_Framework/) and [Foundation](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/ObjC_classic/) frameworks.
