This project is a dummy project. Its main purpose is to demonstrate how Pythonista can be used to create a polished app quite easily. 


The logo for this project was made with the free 'Inkpad' app for IOS.

The layout of the welcome screen was inspired by the Google Hangouts app for IOS.

# This project demonstrates:
- How to use navigation views 
- How to use tableviews. Populate a tableview with files in a directory. 
- How to load and use images and sounds
- How to load multiple pyui views

More features will be added later. If you have any requests please respond in the [dedicated Pythonista forum](https://forum.omz-software.com/topic/2676/share-code-td-ui-module-tutorials).
